 UGAHacks 9 Project
 Contributors: Aaron Verde & Varun Menon
 
 Purpose: The purpose of the project is to have a user interact with the app and be quizzed on multiple
 choice trivia questions about superheroes to better assess their knowledge. The app also shows the results 
 and has replayability for a better user experience.

 Tools: Visual Studio Code, Java, Swing

 Problems: When first trying to implement an API within the application, a myriad of errors arised from 
 the lack of access to the gson library. This error was rooted in maven as it was not accepting the 
 dependencies despite countless efforts and seeking advice from mentors and organizers. Ultimately, 
 we chose to create our own trivia questions without the use of the API.
